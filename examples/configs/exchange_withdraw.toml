# Exchange Withdraw config
# This is a config for a relayer that covers gas for exchange user transactions to withdraw to their wallets in stablecoins

# this is a list of jsons from json key files containing 3 entries: account_id, public_key, secret_key
# NOTE: If you copy/paste the json from the key files, you might need to change private_key to secret_key
# NOTE: account_id for all keys used should match as they should be derived from the same account_id
# this is recommended for high throughput use cases to prevent nonce race conditions
